/**
 * These classes implement a shared mutex.
 * A shared mutex can be held by either a single exclusive lock, or by multiple shared locks.
 * It is most commonly used for synchronization between reader/writer roles.
 *
 * Several implementations exist:
 * - boost::shared_lock, which requires -lboost_system as a runtime dependency
 * - std::shared_timed_mutex, added in c++14
 * - std::shared_mutex, added in c++17
 * As this project does not want to impose requirements beyond c++11, we have our own.
 *
 * This classes do not have a public API. You can expect:
 * - shared_lock is default constructible
 * - read/write_lock_guard each have a constructor taking a reference to a shared_lock
 * - all three classes have a destructor
 * Do not expect these to be copyable or movable, or to have any public methods.
 * We keep it simple, to ensure that any of the implementations mentioned above can later
 * be used as a drop-in replacement.
