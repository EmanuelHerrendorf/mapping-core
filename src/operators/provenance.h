 * Provenance
 *
 * While the Operator graph contains all information required to repeat a specific calculations,
 * it is not always obvious which data was used in the workflow. Operators are free to load
 * any data they deem required for the satisfaction of the query.
 *
 * For example, a rasterdb_source operator with parameter sourcename=foo would be expected
 * to use only data from the raster database named foo. But this is only an expectation from
 * the user, and would need to be verified by looking at the source code of the operator.
 *
 * Instead, we require each operator to provide Provenance information. The rasterdb_source
 * would then report that yes, it is indeed only using data from the rasterdb named foo, along
 * with licence and citation where available.
